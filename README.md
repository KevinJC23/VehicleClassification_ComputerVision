## 📌 Description
**Sea Animal Taxonomy Image Classification** is a computer vision model that can recognize images between Auto Rickshaws, Bikes, Cars, Motorcycles, Planes, Ships, and Trains. In this model, I use a CNN (Convolutional Neural Network) as the algorithm to train the images.

## 🚀 Features
- Upload an image to recognize whether it is categorized as Auto Rickshaws, Bikes, Cars, Motorcycles, Planes, Ships, or Trains.
